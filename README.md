# Customer Spending Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer spending behavior using Python.  
The dataset is based on the **Mall Customer Dataset** (200 customers) and extended with additional demographic and behavioral attributes.  
The goal is to explore how factors such as age, income, gender, occupation, and membership influence customer spending.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Observations**: 200 customers  
- **Original features**:  
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier  
  - `Gender`: Male/Female  
  - `Age`: Age of customer  
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income in thousand dollars  
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: Spending score assigned to each customer  

- **Extended features**:  
  - `Occupation`: Customer’s occupation (Student, Engineer, Manager, Homemaker, Retired, Other)  
  - `ShoppingChannel`: Online or Offline  
  - `MaritalStatus`: Single or Married  
  - `Membership`: Silver, Gold, Platinum

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distribution of age, income, and spending  
  - Relationship between demographics and spending  
- Apply **Statistical Analysis**:
  - T-test: Compare spending between genders  
  - ANOVA: Compare spending across occupations  
  - Chi-square: Relationship between shopping channel and gender  
  - Confidence Interval: Estimate mean spending score  
- Generate **insights** and recommendations for customer segmentation and marketing strategies
